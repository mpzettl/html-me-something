            <p><h1>Golden Myanmar ~ Shwe Myanmar</h1></p>
            <p><h4>This is Burma, and it is quite unlike any land you know about--Rudyard Kipling</h4></p>
            
            <div>   
                
                
                <p><h2>Since 2014 my wife and I have visited Myanmar (Also known as Burma) 3 times, totaling one year of time spent in the country. We were originally introduced to this incredible culture by means of refugees who have fled the country's 70 year old civil war and resettled here in the United States.</h2></p>
                
                <p><h2>We love the Myanmar people we have met as they are very cheerful and hospitable, and very family oriented, no matter what tribe or ethnicity. When invited to their homes, you are almost always offered a cup of tea or coffee, milky and sweet just as they favor. Food is always on offer to guests, small mandarin oranges are ubiquitous; sugar cane and a favorite, often spicy, lahpet thoke ~ pickled tea leaves, so traditional and much better tasting than it sounds.</h2></p>
                
                <p><h2>Myanmar is a very spiritual place, as there are thousands of pagodas and payas, temples; Even for non-Buddhist citizens, peoples' thinking and actions are deeply affected by Theravada Buddhism.
                    As you fly over the country, you notice little glints of gold dotted across the landscape, through the haze low on the ground. Those are the temples, pagodas or payas, often coated with gold leaf. The Grand Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon gleams golden yellow for miles as they light it up at night. Among the many gems built into it, there is a huge diamond atop its 344 foot center spire.
                </h2></p>

                <p><h2>The Myanmar language is related to Chinese and Tibetan, though it's writing is derived largely from Pali, a religous language from India. It looks like an alphabet of circles, and largely reads that way as well.
                    The sounds are very different from English that we are used to, it is a tonal language with very fine differences in aspiration that foreigners have great difficulty ever being able to distinguish correctly.
                    This makes it very difficult and confusing to transliterate into English, not that English gives any assistance, but it itself adds great difficulty due to its own wide range of sounds and dialects spoken all over the world.

                </h2></p>

                <p><h2>Life there is very, very different from life in the West.
                    In fact thinking and customs are often the opposite of customs here.
                    There are many examples of this, but one is immediately apparent once you get into your taxi and are whisked away from the airport to your hotel: While cars and trucks drive on the right (American: correct) side of the road, the driver usually (90% of the time) is seated also on the right. This is largely due to the fact that for many years, importers have mainly imported used vehicles from Japan and Thailand, both countries where drivers drive on the left.

                </h2></p>
                <p><h2>While Main Street is the main street in the USA, in Myanmar the major thoroughfare in almost any city is named after the father of Aung San Suu Kyi(Currently the State Counsellor, a post crafted by her assasinated chief counsel that puts her above the President): Bokyoke Aung San, or Bokyoke (street) in common usage.
                    The biggest market, really the tourist market in the largest city Yangon (Rangoon) is Bokyoke Market. He was assasinated in 1947 shortly after convincing the British to agree leave (which they did), and is far and away the most famous personage in the country.
                    Bokyoke is pronounced more like Bo-Jo(ke), barely saying the final k syllable at all. In fact, other than 'n', the Burmese language has no final consonants at all. Transliteration inserts them to try to get English speakers to get somewhere near the correct sound when trying to speak Burmese. Transliteration leads astray with spellings like Kyi, Gyi: sounding like Chee and Gee respectively. There is no 'ing' sound per se in the Myanmar language, though n followed by gy~ can make it sound like it exists.
