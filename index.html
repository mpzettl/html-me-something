            <p><h4>This is Burma, and it is quite unlike any land you know about--Rudyard Kipling</h4></p>
            
            <div id = "wrapper">   
                
                
                <p><h2>Since 2014 my wife and I have visited Myanmar 3 times, totaling one year of time spent in the country. We were originally introduced to this incredible culture by means of refugees who have fled the country's 70 year old civil war and resettled here in the United States.</h2></p>
                
                <p><h2>We love the Myanmar people we have met as they are very cheerful and hospitable, and very family oriented, no matter what tribe or ethnicity.</h2></p>
                
                <p><h2>Myanmar is a very spiritual place, as there are thousands of Payas, or temples; Even for non-Buddhist citizens, their thinking and actions are deeply affected by Therevada Buddhism.</h2></p>

                <p><h2>The Myanmar language is related to Chinese and Tibetan, though it's writing is derived largely from Pali, a religous language from India. It looks like an alphabet of circles, and largely reads that way as well.
                    The sounds are very different from English that we are used to, it is a tonal language with very fine differences in aspiration that foreigners have great difficulty ever being able to distinguish correctly.
                    This makes it very difficult and confusing to transliterate into English, not that English gives any assistance, but it itself adds great difficulty due to its own wide range of sounds and dialects spoken all over the world.

                </h2></p>

                <p><h2>Life there is very, very different from life in the West.
                    In fact thinking and customs are often the opposite of customs here.
                    There are many examples of this, but one is immediately apparent once you get into your taxi and are whisked away from the airport to your hotel: While cars and trucks drive on the right (American: correct) side of the road, the driver usually (90% of the time) is seated also on the right. This is largely due to the fact that for many years, importers have mainly imported used vehicles from Japan and Thailand, both countries where drivers drive on the left.

                </h2></p>
                <p><h2>While Main Street is the main street in the USA, in Myanmar the major thoroughfare in almost any city is named after the father of Aung San Suu Kyi: Bokyoke Aung San, or Bokyoke (street) in common usage.
                    The biggest market, really the tourist market in the largest city Yangon (Rangoon) is Bokyoke Market. He was assasinated in 1947 shortly after getting the British to leave, and is far and away the most famous personage in the country.
                    Bokyoke is pronounced more like Bo-Jo(ke), barely saying the final k syllable at all. In fact, other than 'n', the Burmese language has no final consonants at all. Transliteration inserts them to try to get English speakers to get somewhere near the correct sound when trying to speak Burmese.

                </h2></p>
